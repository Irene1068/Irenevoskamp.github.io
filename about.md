I believe the best leaders don’t just deliver technology — they help people and organizations find clarity in complexity and turn risk into opportunity.

With 15+ years in high-stakes environments — from counterintelligence operations supporting U.S. national security, to cloud computing at Microsoft and AWS, to protecting my neighbors from literal fires — I’ve learned that **trust, alignment, and resilience** carry organizations through transformation.

I bring not just strategy and delivery, but a commitment to building teams and solutions that endure.
